Description:
  Short: acoustic analysis for 2-party dialogues
  Long: >
    The purpose of the scripts contained in this Praat plugin is to obtain
    acoustic data from long casual speech recordings. It is expected that
    these data might eventually help in the diagnosis of some specific
    neurological pathologies.

    The current version of these scripts make measurements for each spoken
    interval. Future versions might improve the resolution of these
    measurements, so they can be obtained from smaller windows.
